# Caloric Fun
This project is submitted to **Bon Hacketit 2.0**.

## Inspiration💡
We Believe Fitness Should Be Accessible To Everyone, Everywhere, Regardless Of Income Or Access To A Gym. With Hundreds Of Professional Workouts, Healthy Recipes And Informative Articles, As Well As The Responsive Web Interface, You’ll Have Everything You Need To Reach Your Personal Fitness Goals

## What it does
The platform recommends nutritious recipes. The platform has several articles on caloric diets. We created a calorie calculator that is linked with Twilio. It also has a web app that recommends surprise caloric tips and tricks.

## How we built it❓
**Twilio Calorie Tracker**
Our Twilio Bot recognizes the Fat, Protein, Carbs, and Calories based on the Food Pictures you sent. It can also provide you with the recipe for making that food. We used spooncular API for recognition of the Food and Analysing it. Twilio made it a lot easier for us to make a bot on Whatsapp.
**Daily Caloric Tips**
This is a Web app that provides you with different categories of random recipes. It gives you Daily Caloric Tips. Simple Tips, Random Recipe, Food Trivia's, And Jokes To Maintain Your Weight Loss And Fitness Success.

## Challenges we ran into🎢
We have faced some challenges, one of them was setting up a domain name from the domain.com registry. We also faced some issues with setting up our Twilio Bot and Google Cloud but we made it all work in the end.

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE PROUD OF🏅🏆
We are happy to assemble a solution to assist everyone by planning their diet and promoting healthy foods. We are glad that we managed our time and features to work quickly and on schedule.

We are proud of the final project we built. We learned a lot while working on the project not just technically but also time management. We are proud we could complete the project and deliver a beautiful fully functional Hack this weekend.

## What we learned📚
We learned a lot this weekend.
We learned some frontend designing skills and sliderjs.
- How to develop fast, scalable, and simple web applications.
- How to leverage Google Cloud products in our own application.
- Finally, we learned a lot from each other and MLH over the weekend.

## Time Management⏱⌛⏳🏃‍♂️ 
We had a tough time managing time this weekend with our participation in this Hackathon as we had to work on multiple things altogether. Fortunately, we could do this by distributing out our work and focusing on multitasking. Extremely excited for all the teachings we had got through this hack.

## Hosting👩‍🏫👩‍💻 
We learned how to claim a custom domain from Domain.com and make the hosting work out.

## What's next for Caloric Fun🔭
We believe that this web app can help improve the access to Healthy Recipes, Informative Articles regardless of their income. We want to add more features to make the users engage with the platform and expand the web app to mobile apps.
